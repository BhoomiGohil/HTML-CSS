# CSS Flexbox

It is a great example of CSS Flexbox by Jen Kramer on the Front End Master course which I practice and the website's visual design is available below.

There are some differences between float and flex. You can go ahead and compare my other repository Float with the same example. You can also notice that the float method has some flaws regarding smaller screen sizes.

Note: Updated card radius and padding compared to Jen Kramer's design.
