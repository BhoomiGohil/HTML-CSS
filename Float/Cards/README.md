# CSS Float

It is a simple responsive webpage made with a media query and an example of float by Jen Kramer on the Front end Master course which I practice and the website's visual design is available below. The float method has some flaws compared to the flex method.

Note: Updated card radius and padding compared to Jen Kramer's design.
